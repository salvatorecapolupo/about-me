# ON THE WIRE


[salvatorecapolupo.github.io/about-me/](https://salvatorecapolupo.github.io/about-me/)

It’s 2024. Somewhere between the crystalline hum of server racks and the white noise of a classroom projector, I became **de facto**. No more contracts, no more gigs. It’s official now — plugged in for good.

The code I push isn’t just bits on a repository, it’s a signal sent across the grid. Echoes of lessons, algorithms spun like threads in the neural networks of minds young and sharp. I teach, I code, and the world mutates.

This GitHub is a terminal into that world — code that lives and breathes in the binary veins of our reality, projects that bend circuits to logic and knowledge to power. Here, everything is modular, like a decker’s rig: pull what you need, patch into your own feed.

I’ve been in the trenches of the digital frontier, but now, I write the rules.

## Repositories

- **`code/`** — Scripts from a thousand sleepless nights. Clean, efficient, built to last. Each one’s a lesson if you’re sharp enough to see it.
- **`modules/`** — Expandable, adaptable. Like pulling new gear from cyberspace. Drop them into your own build and run.
- **`docs/`** — Tutorials? Maybe. Guides to the terminal realities of data structures, algorithms, and the architectures that govern the backend of everything.

Remember: the grid cannot remember, neither wait.
